<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited
        about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous
        vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
        you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
        plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
        set to the target temperature of the food. In
        his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
        Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
        poaching</q>.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide
        Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve
        a seat at the chef table, contact us before
        November 30.</p>

    <p>Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
